## Purpose

This C++ code computes 1b and 2b density matrices by expanding a reference state in a basis of Slater determinants. The code has been converted to C++ from Python. The original Python code is found here (gitlab.msu.edu/imsrg/pyci). The code is intended to be used as a library.

## How to use

Run `cmake` to generate the Makefile and `make` to build the code. The Makefile binds the code to a library, which you can link to your own code to access the density matrix-generating functions.
